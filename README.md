### Hi! 👋 I'm meleu, from Brazil 🇧🇷.

I'm Linux nerd since the late 90s and currently I work as a DevOps Specialist (dealing with GCP, gitlab-ci, NodeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and a bunch of other nerdy things).

I love bash and I try to apply Clean Code concepts on my scripts. If you like shell-scripts and also care for your code, let's connect!

btw, I also love 🕹️ [retroachievements](https://retroachievements.org/) 👾

I write a blog (**in portuguese**) totally focused on the shell: <https://meleu.sh>
