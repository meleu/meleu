# Hi! 👋 I'm meleu

- 🧑‍💻 **Software Engineer**, dealing with things like
    - Ruby on Rails
    - JavaScript/TypeScript
    - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions and GitLab CI)
    - containers (Docker / Kubernetes / ArgoCD)
    - Cloud providers (GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean)
    - DevOps practices (bring quality as near to the origin as possible!)

- 📝 Currently writing [Learn Ruby with TDD](https://tdd-ruby.gitbook.io/)

- 🐧 I'm a Linux nerd since the late 90s

- 📚 Topics I'm currently delving into:
    - Convince people that high quality code is the cheaper way to go fast
    - Test-Driven Development
    - Software Architecture

- 🧼 I like my code clean and easy to maintain.

- 🤓 I write a blog (**in portuguese**) totally focused on the terminal environment: <https://meleu.sh>
